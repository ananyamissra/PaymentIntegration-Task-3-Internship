# Web-Development-Task-3: Payment Gateway Integration

Welcome to the **Payment Integration for Donation** project! This repository contains the HTML and CSS files for creating a user-friendly and responsive payment integration system for online donations. This was made for my Sparks Foundation- GRIP Internship Program.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a web page that allows users to make donations to a specific cause or organization. The project involves creating a visually appealing and responsive interface that guides users through the donation process and integrates with a simulated payment gateway.


## Project Features

- **Responsive Design**: The project includes responsive design considerations, making the donation page accessible and visually appealing on different devices and screen sizes.

- **Donation Form**: A well-designed donation form allows users to enter their information, select a donation amount, and choose a payment method.

- **Payment Gateway Simulation**: While not performing actual transactions, the project simulates the interaction with a payment gateway. Users receive feedback on successful or failed donation attempts.

- **Visual Appeal**: The CSS files provide styling for an attractive and user-friendly interface. Color choices, typography, and layout contribute to a visually appealing experience.

## Usage

Feel free to use this project as a reference for building donation integration pages, practicing HTML and CSS, or improving your responsive design skills.
